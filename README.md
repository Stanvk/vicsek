### Vicsek model - A Python :snake: implementation!

Collective motion and swarm behaviour can be studied by utilizing the Vicsek model. Here, a particle at a certain position and constant speed in
an arbitrary direction aligns with the mean orientation of it's neighbouring particles at each time step.

#### Requirements
- Python 3
- matplotlib (*for animation purposes only*)
- numpy

#### Getting Started
Using the simulation is fairly simple once matplotlib and numpy are installed. The example.py file gives a example of how the simulator and animator can be used.
